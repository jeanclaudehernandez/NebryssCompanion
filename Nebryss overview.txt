### **The Mist and Its Effects**  
- **Mist Density Levels**: Ships must be optimized for different mist densities.  
  - **Denser Mist**: Provides more power to mist engines but increases risks of anomalies and attacks.  
  - **Lighter Mist**: Requires more efficient engines but offers safer navigation.  
- **Above and Below the Mist**: Ships primarily fly above the mist but can dip below for tactical or emergency reasons (extremely dangerous).  
- **Mist-Weaving Technology**:  
  - **Overview**: Mist-weaving is an ancient and mystical practice unique to the **Nebryssian Liberation Republic (NLR)**, rooted in the planet’s connection to the enigmatic mist. Unlike mist engines, which are purely technological, mist-weaving is a blend of ritualistic magic and ancestral knowledge. It is performed by **Mistweavers**, shamans who channel the mist’s energy through sacred rituals. The NLR views mist-weaving as a gift from their ancestors, though they do not fully understand the mist’s true nature.  
  - **How It Works**:  
    - **Rituals and Sacrifice**: Mist-weaving requires elaborate rituals, often involving chants, offerings, and the use of sacred artifacts. The most powerful effects, such as creating temporary mist zones, come at a great cost—usually the life of the Mistweaver.  
    - **Temporary Mist Zones**: Mistweavers can create low-density mist zones that are temporary and localized. These zones are not stable enough for trade or long-term use but are invaluable in desperate situations.  
      - **Escape**: Mist zones can be used to obscure NLR forces, allowing them to retreat from overwhelming enemy forces or evade pursuit.  
      - **Ambush**: Mist zones can be deployed to disorient and isolate enemy targets, creating opportunities for precise, high-stakes strikes against critical objectives.  
    - **Limitations**: Mist-weaving is a slow and laborious process, requiring significant time and resources. The effects are temporary, and the mist zones dissipate after a short period.  
  - **Limitations and Risks**:  
    - **Psychic Strain**: Mist-weaving takes a heavy toll on the Mistweaver’s mind and body. Prolonged use can lead to exhaustion, physical deterioration, or even death.  
    - **Cultural Secrecy**: The NLR guards mist-weaving technology fiercely, ensuring that no other faction can replicate it. This secrecy has led to rumors and superstitions about the practice, with some outsiders viewing it as heretical or demonic.  
  - **Cultural Significance**:  
    - Mist-weaving is central to NLR identity, symbolizing their connection to the planet and their ancestors. It is both a weapon and a tool, embodying their struggle for independence and their reverence for the mist.

    - **Other Factions**: The remaining 60% of mist engines are produced by other factions or independent manufacturers. While these engines vary in quality, none can match the craftsmanship of the Accord’s designs.  
  - **Optimization Categories**:  
    - **Speed**: Faster travel but sacrifices endurance and cargo space.
