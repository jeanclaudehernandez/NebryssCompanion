# **Altered States**  

| **Name**         | **Effect**                                                                                                                                                        |  
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Entangled**    | The operative cannot perform actions that involve moving. At the start of its activation, roll **1D6 + APL**. On a **6+**, remove this state.                     |  
| **Bleeding**     | At the start of the operative’s activation, it suffers **1D3 wounds**. Roll **1D6 + APL** at the end of its activation. On a **5+**, remove this state.           |
| **Burning**      | At the start of the operative’s activation, it suffers **1 wound**. After 3 Activations, remove this state.                                                       |
| **Supressed**    | When this operative would activate, instead skip it's activation and remove this state.                                                                           |
| **Mistbound**    | Operative treats all terrain as mist zone, if in a mistzone increase density. At the start of its activation, roll **1D6 + APL**. On a **5+**, remove this state. |
| **Electrified**  | At the start of the operative’s activation, it suffers 1D3 wounds and cannot retain critical successes. To remove, spend 1AP to "ground" itself.                  |
| **Corrupted**    | Operative loses 1APL and suffers 1 wound at the end of each activation. Roll **1D6 + APL** at the end of its activation. On a **6+**, remove this state.          |
| **Disoriented**  | Worsen WS/BS by 1. Roll **1D6 + APL** at the end of its activation. On a **4+**, remove this state.                                                               |
